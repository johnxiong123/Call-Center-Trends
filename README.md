# Call-Center-Trends

### INTRODUCTION
This is a Power BI project on customer satisfaction and agent behaviour analysis for a telecom company known as “PhoneNow”. This is the Task one with PwC Switzerland for a Power BI virtual case experience on Forage.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Call Center Manager, Claire, at PhoneNow, needs transparency and insights from the dataset gathered in the first quarter of 2021. Most especially, an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour.

The main objective of this project was to create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

The Key Performance Indicators include:

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- The average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant, that is, average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

### DATA SOURCING
The dataset was obtained through PwC Switzerland Case Experience on Forage which contains data on customers, calls received, calls resolved, attending agent, time and duration of calls, and date of calls received.

The data is in a structured Excel Worksheet document (xls) format. It contains 10 columns and 5000 rows. The table had the following columns:

- Call ID: It contains unique identity codes for individual calls received.
- Agent: It contains the name of the agent that received the call.
- Answered: It contains the status of the call received, either answered or missed.
- Average Talk Duration: It contains the average duration of the call.
- Date: It contains the date the calls were received
- Resolved: It contains data on the status of the reason for the call, either resolved or not.
- Satisfaction rating: It contains the satisfaction rating by the customer.
- Speed of answer in seconds: It contains how fast (in seconds) the call was answered.
- Time: It contains the exact time the call was received.
- Topic: It contains the reason the customer called.
